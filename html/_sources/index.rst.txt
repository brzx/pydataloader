**A python based data loader for differenct target**

Five scenario in iLoad data process can be used for transformation

- Direct
- Lookup
- Function
- Key upsert
- Variable

1. Direct

|direct|

::

  For direct data loading, the target data is 
  same as the data in source file.

#. Lookup

|lookup|

::

  For lookup data loading, the target data is 
  replaced by a transformation rule like: 
  src.ProductName = r1.name

#. Function

|function|

::

  For function data loading, the target data is 
  replaced by a transformation rule like: 
  src.Fieldforce||’’_’’||src.Country||’’_’’||src.DoctorName

#. Key upsert

|keyupdate|

::

  For key upsert data loading, it can set up a 
  field as key in iLoad, if not set up a key, 
  iLoad will only do insert operation

#. Variable

|variable1|
|variable2|

::

  If a function field need a source field not 
  in source file, but it can be transformed by 
  another rule, it can set up a variable for 
  that. 
  Such as:
  A. Target field External ID need country join 
     product external ID
  B. But source file only have product name
  C. So set up a variable with lookup rule 
     src.ProductName = r1.name
  D. Then use this variable in function rule 
     src.Country||’’_’’||variable_name

::

  Other key functions
  1. It can load data to single table immediately
  2. It can load data to single table scheduled
  3. After configurate single table template, it can set up 
     a multiple table sequence for scheduled data loading
  4. It can review scheduled single or multiple tasks
